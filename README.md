# PythonOrganizeDownloadsFiles

This project has been created just for "Fun". The main.py file is a script to organize the Downloads user folder aiming to separate most common files by file extension.

For each file that was found on Downloads folder, check if the extension is PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV or even TXT, if that's true move the file to the respective folder
